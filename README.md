# CSS-Zen-Garden

## Intro

This repository is a [CSS Zen Garden] (http://www.csszengarden.com/) inspired by the De Stijl movement of the early 1900's. Through this project, all styling is made from only CSS, leaving all HTML untouched.

This work was completed over one weekend, with small edits and updates ongoing.
